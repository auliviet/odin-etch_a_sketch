## Instructions
- Create a page 16x16 grid of square divs
-- Divs to be created using JavaScript and placed within a container
-- Use flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through
- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid
-- The existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) 
-- Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100

## Extra credits 
- Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction.
- Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.
